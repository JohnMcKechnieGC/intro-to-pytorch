# PyTorch Demo
This PyTorch demo is based around some of the ideas we encountered when looking at the browser-based [TensorFlow playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/).

The pre-trained neural network for image classification demo is adapted from chapter 2 of Deep Learning with PyTorch by Thomas Viehmann, Eli Stevens, Luca Pietro Giovanni Antiga, Manning Publications. The original code is available from the book's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code/blob/master/p1ch2/2_pre_trained_networks.ipynb).

In class we also saw a couple of reference implementations from the [PyTorch Pocket Reference](http://pytorchbook.com) book by [Joe Papa](http://joepapa.ai); content is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/joe-papa/pytorch-book).
